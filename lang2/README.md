**IMPORTANT NOTE:** WORK IN PROGRESS! Do not expect this to be working.

ink! is an [eDSL](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) to write WebAssembly based smart contracts using the Rust programming language targeting Substrate blockchains.

### Scripts

Use the scripts provided under `scripts` directory in order to run checks on either the workspace or all examples. Please do this before pushing work in a PR.

### Examples

For running the example smart contracts found under `examples` you also need to install some further tools:

- `wabt` (WebAssembly Binary Toolkit)
- `wasm-utils` (Parity's Wasm Utilities)

For more information how to install these on your system go [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/contracts/installing-ink#wasm-utilities).

### Testing

Off-chain testing is done by `cargo test`.
If you want to test all workspace crates, do `cargo test --all`.

## Example

Below is an example using ink! demonstrating a simple Flipper smart contract
that has a boolean state that can be flipped or returned.

```rust
contract! {
    /// Specify concrete implementation of contract environment types
    #![env = ink_core::env::DefaultSrmlTypes]

    /// Flips its state between `true` and `false`.
    struct Flipper {
        /// The current state of our flag.
        value: storage::Value<bool>,
    }

    impl Deploy for Flipper {
        /// Initializes our state to `false` upon deploying our smart contract.
        fn deploy(&mut self) {
            self.value.set(false)
        }
    }

    impl Flipper {
        /// Flips the current state of our smart contract.
        pub(external) fn flip(&mut self) {
            *self.value = !*self.value;
        }

        /// Returns the current state.
        pub(external) fn get(&self) -> bool {
            *self.value
        }
    }
}

/// Run off-chain tests with `cargo test`.
#[cfg(tests)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let mut flipper = Flipper::deploy_mock();
        assert_eq!(flipper.get(), false);
        flipper.flip();
        assert_eq!(flipper.get(), true);
    }
}
```

## Goals

### Core Goals

| | |
|:-:|:-|
| **Ecosystem** | Easy integration with the Rust ecosystem. |
| **Tooling** | Rust tooling works out-of-the-box for smart contract code. This includes auto-completion, syntax highlighting, code coverage for tests, go-to definitions and other IDE goodies. |
| **Testing** | Easy to build, test, deploy and run. |
| **Development** | Development can be done entirely off-chain to speed up the process. |

### Key Attributes

| | |
|:-:|:-|
| **Efficient** | Compile smart contract code to machine code that is _at least_ as efficient as if you used the low-level function calls directly. |
| **Robust** | Make it as simple as possible to write code that just does what is expected and as difficult as possible to write incorrect or exploitable code. |
| **Simple** | Smart contract code should be as easy-to-read as possible. |
| **Accessible** | Make it accessible to users by providing excellent documentation and teaching materials. |

## Structure

| Module | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `cli` | A minimalist tool to setup a smart contract project easily. |
| `core` | The core utilities used to write smart contracts. |
| `model` | Medium-level abstractions to write smart contracts heavily inspired by [Fleetwood](https://github.com/paritytech/fleetwood). |
| `lang` | The actual eDSL based on `ink_core` and `ink_model` to provide a user friendly interface to writing smart contract code. |
| `examples` | Features some smart contracts written for clarity with focus on teaching users how to use pDSL to write their own contracts. |
